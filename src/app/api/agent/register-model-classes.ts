/**
 * Model-class serialization registration for the STEP runtime.
 *
 * WorkflowAgent serializes its LanguageModel instance across the
 * workflow→step boundary (into `doStreamStep`). Two problems with the stock
 * setup, both fixed here:
 *
 * 1. The withWorkflow compiler inlines the class registration for
 *    `DeepSeekChatLanguageModel` into the workflow (flow) bundle only, so the
 *    step route can't deserialize the model at all ("Class … not found").
 * 2. Even with the class registered, @ai-sdk/deepseek's own
 *    `WORKFLOW_DESERIALIZE` re-news the class with the serialized config —
 *    which necessarily dropped the non-serializable `url`/`fetch` functions
 *    (`serializeModelOptions` keeps JSON-safe values only), so the first
 *    request dies with "this.config.url is not a function".
 *
 * So instead of the broken stock deserializer we register a host whose
 * deserializer REBUILDS the model through the `deepseek()` factory: the
 * serialized payload's `modelId` is all it needs, and the factory restores a
 * complete config (baseURL, auth headers from DEEPSEEK_API_KEY, url/fetch)
 * from the step runtime's environment.
 *
 * Imported for its side effect from ./tool-executors.ts, which the loader
 * compiles into the step bundle — so registration runs on every step-route
 * cold start before any doStreamStep message is handled.
 *
 * The classId format is fixed by the compiler: `class//<pkg>@<version>//<ClassName>`.
 * The version comes from the installed package.json, so upgrades stay in sync.
