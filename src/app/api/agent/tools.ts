//     (inclusive YYYY-MM-DD), one compact pointer line per slice. This is YOUR
//     tool when the user's question carries an explicit time anchor ("last
//     week", "September 3rd", "in March"). Scope the window, then open the

//   - readSlice: point-read the original slice text. Use it to answer from a
//     slice you located on the time axis, or to verify a recall reference.
//
// Topic-axis / unanchored questions go DIRECTLY to recall — never investigate
// first and then escalate. If the question has NO time anchor ("did we ever
// talk about apples?", fuzzy memories, cross-topic synthesis), call recall
// immediately. If you realize mid-scan that the time axis can't settle it,
// stop and call recall rather than continuing to dig.
//
// The other granular memory-browse tools (readSliceSummary / readAgentTimeline /
