/**
 * runCardEvolution — the inline, synchronous user-model evolution step.
 *
 * Evolution runs synchronously inside the turn's scribe segment (v0.19 A1),
 * on the EXPLICIT memory_update channel only (§A.3.2 — the fitness trigger
 * chain is retired). This function is the callable core: given the current
 * model + the content to fold in, it runs the Previously Agent (which edits
 * the card through validated MUTATION tools — never a whole-file rewrite),
 * and writes both the folded live model (people/user/index.md, §B.7 — card
 * and direction halves in ONE document) and the per-slice previously.md
 * snapshot (the FULL index.md as it stands) when the substance moved.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO mechanical post-processing of the agent's output:
 * caps and format are enforced inside the write tools (rejections come back
 * with compression instructions), so every byte of the final card is the
 * agent's own decision. Engineering owns the channel and the write-back;
 * the model owns the content.
 *
 * v1.1 (merged run): at a slice boundary the ONE agent run also evaluates
 * direction.md FIRST (input.directionEval) and edits a working copy through
 * ATOMIC direction mutation ops. This function gates the resulting doc
 * (validateDirectionProposal, mode-aware), retires expired hypotheses
 * deterministically (retireExpiredHypotheses — the pool TTL is engineering's
 * half of the lifecycle, and it runs even on a no-change verdict), and
 * applies through writeUserModelDirection — the direction half of the folded
 * index.md. A rejected doc is logged and skipped, never fatal; the verdict
 * rides the result's `direction` field for the terminal data-evolution frame.
 *
 * Streaming is surfaced via the optional `onProgress` callback (phase steps)
 * and `onEvolutionLine` (the Previously Agent's live thinking/writing lines)
 * so the caller (the scribe segment) can push data-evolution chunks to the
 * client — no idle wait.
