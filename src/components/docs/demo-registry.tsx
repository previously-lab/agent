/**
 * Demo registry — maps `demo: <id>` preview-fence IDs to live component examples.
 *
 * Each entry provides:
 * - label: short human-readable title for the card header
 * - code: the JSX source shown alongside the live render
 * - render: a function returning the rendered element (called inside a
 *           client component so hooks and interactivity work)
 *
 * Add entries here as new demo-worthy components emerge. Keep the code
 * snippets self-contained — no import statements; all dependencies are
 * already in scope via the DemoPlayground scope map.
