/**
 * Turn-merge helper for the finalize-turn write-conflict self-heal.
 *
 * When a turn's batched commit loses a non-fast-forward race on GitHub
 * (another turn or process committed to the branch first), the queued slice
 * file was computed from a STALE base. Turns are append-only, so the merge is
 * mechanical: re-parse the remote core.md, append every local turn the remote
 * is missing (keyed by turnId), union the loop pointers, and re-serialize.
 * The caller swaps the merged content into the batch and retries the commit.
 *
 * Pure module — no I/O — so it is unit-testable and safe to import anywhere.
