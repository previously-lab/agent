/**
 * Shared I/O helpers for the episodic memory subsystem.
 *
 * All file reads/writes/listing routes through these three functions, which
 * delegate to the correct backend based on environment:
 *   - Demo mode → demo-fs (remote benchmark data)
 *   - GitHub mode → GitHub API (production)
 *   - Otherwise   → local filesystem (dev)
 *
 * Batch mode: a `WriteBatch` is an EXPLICIT object (`createBatch()`) that the
 * owning step threads through every I/O call in its write window. Passing the
 * batch to `fsWriteFile` queues the write in-memory instead of hitting the
 * backend; passing it to `fsReadFile` checks the pending queue first, so
 * writes earlier in the same batch are visible to later reads (read-your-
 * writes, preserving ordering dependencies). `flushBatch(batch, message)`
 * commits all queued writes as a single git commit (GitHub mode) or writes
 * them to disk and records one best-effort git commit when the memory root
 * is a git repo (local — see local-git.ts). Because the batch is a per-call
 * object — not a module global — two turns running concurrently in one
 * process can never flush each other's writes.
 *
 * Extracted from manager.ts to avoid circular imports: global-timeline.ts and
 * recall.ts need these helpers, but importing them from manager.ts would create
 * a cycle when manager.ts itself needs to call generateGlobalTimeline.
