/**
 * Rework-signal instrumentation (v1.0 design §2.6).
 *
 * The most valuable implicit fitness signal: the main agent calls `recall`,
 * then opens slices ITSELF with readSlice. readSlice stays in the chat tool
 * surface as the VERIFICATION channel (design §1.4), so not every post-recall
 * read is a penalty:
 *
 *   - "verify" — the read slice was among recall's references (the by-design
 *     audit path), or within the set recall searched (the main agent pulling
 *     more original text from a slice recall already surfaced — recall.ts's
 *     contract explicitly allows this).
 *   - "rework" — a recall ran this conversation and the read slice was NOT in
 *     its references or searched trail: the main agent is doing recall's job
 *     itself, i.e. recall's answer was not trusted/used.
 *   - null — no recall has run this conversation (nothing to compare against),
 *     or the read target IS the ongoing conversation slice.
 *
 * doc_rework (v0.15 design §4.4) extends the same instrument from the
 * document side: a readDoc whose text references slice X, followed by the
 * main agent opening slice X itself, means the document was not credited
 * for the fact it carried. Same fitness store, same recall bucket — the
 * mechanism serves memory quality no matter which producer is involved.
 *
 * The per-conversation record is module-level per-process state — the same
 * pattern manager.ts already uses for the active slice. Workflow steps in one
 * process share the module, so the recall outcome recorded by recallExecute is
 * visible to a later readSliceExecute. The map is FIFO-bounded: conversations
 * are short-lived and an unbounded map would leak across the process lifetime.
 *
 * Every emitted signal lands in TWO places, both best-effort (failures are
 * swallowed with a console.warn — instrumentation must never fail a tool):
 *   1. the fitness store (machine-readable, for the analyzer stage), and
 *   2. one compact structured line in the CURRENT slice's agent.md
 *      (human/audit-readable), via manager.ts's writeAgentTimeline.
