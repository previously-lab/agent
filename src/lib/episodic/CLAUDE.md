# Episodic Memory Subsystem

## Overview

The episodic memory subsystem records, indexes, and recalls conversation history as discrete **time slices** -- one per real conversation session (closed by slice age — 30 min from slice start, context loss, or a 50-turn safety cap), stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. A calendar day is a *directory* that may hold multiple slice files. Only the identity constitution (`identity/agent/`) is bundled at build time; all episodic data is fetched on-demand at runtime.

All internal sub-agent calls — recall search, the unified turn analyze (tag extraction + semantic hint + intent + slice marking), belief evolution (the Previously Agent), strand consolidation, mark backfill — run on the MAIN model through the shared sub-agent runner (`src/lib/agents/sub-agent-runner.ts`, thinking ON at low effort, shared `SHARED_SUBAGENT_BASE` prompt prefix). Single model: everything runs on the selected model — the old worker tier is gone. The main model handles user-facing chat. The core agent only reads memory; writes to tags/strands happen mechanically in the housekeeping step.

File storage is abstracted behind a local-filesystem vs. GitHub API switch, gated on `GITHUB_TOKEN`. All paths are under `memory/episodic/`.

## File Map

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `types.ts` | All type definitions: `TimeSlice`, `Turn`, `SliceFrontmatter`, `SlicingSignal`, `EmotionalTone`, `SliceIndexEntry`, `MonthlyIndex`, `StrandIndex` |
| `index.ts` | Barrel export -- re-exports from `manager.ts` and `slicer.ts` |
| `manager.ts` | Core CRUD: in-memory active slice, path helpers, gray-matter serialization/parsing, turn append, snapshot saves, monthly index and tag index maintenance, previously.md I/O |
| `slicer.ts` | Slicing decision engine — slice age cap (30 min from slice start) |
| `maintenance.ts` | Deprecated v1 module — retained as a stub. Sub-agent calls now live in `flash/recall.ts`, `flash/previously-agent.ts`, and `flash/turn-analyzer.ts`. |
| `actions.ts` | Server actions (`"use server"`) for UI consumption: `getEpisodicState`, `getTimelineCatalog` (full catalog), `getSlicePageWithContent` (catalog-derived cursor pagination WITH turns — v0.10 unified message flow), `getArrivalState` (resume-vs-briefing gate reusing `slicing.idleGapMinutes`), `getSliceContent` (single-slice detail for /timeline and search jumps), previously/agent-timeline/memory-docs readers. |
| `turn-parser.ts` | Pure functions to parse core.md into frontmatter + parsed turns, apply range filters, reassemble filtered slices |
| `flash/recall.ts` | Recall sub-agent colleague (main model via the shared runner) — answers natural-language questions about past conversations, reading slices itself (timeline/strands/summaries/full reads, quota-bounded); every situational claim is anchored to verbatim-quote references |
| `flash/turn-analyzer.ts` | The one housekeeping sub-agent call (main model via the shared runner): message tags + semantic hint + intent + (on close) slice marking + fitness scoring (Task 7 — per-slice evidence-anchored deltas per bucket, v1.0 §2.5; this slice's mechanical signals are an input) |
| `flash/global-timeline.ts` | Global timeline file aggregating all slice summaries |
| `flash/previously-agent.ts` | Previously Agent (main model via the shared sub-agent runner, thinking ON at low effort) — the evolution loop's MERGED run (v1.1): at a slice boundary it evaluates direction.md FIRST (the optional `directionEval` input; moves are ATOMIC direction mutation ops — addPortraitEntry / addHypothesis / promoteHypothesis / … — on a working copy, per-op validated by `applyDirectionOps` with code-stamped `proposed` pointers; the caller runs the whole-doc gate + the engineering hypothesis TTL and applies via `writeDirection`), then edits the user card under the possibly-new portrait through validated MUTATION tools (never a whole-file rewrite); rejected writes come back with compression instructions, the session loop brake force-lands repeated identical rejections, and a step-limit stop returns a PARTIAL card instead of failing. Also owns `writePlaybook` — the gated (triggered-bucket-only) mutation of a sub-agent's playbook |
| `previously-format.ts` | previously.md format — v3 archive (read-only history) + v5 user card (Identity / Past = profile paragraph + anchor facts / Now = agent-expired hooks / Horizon = future commitments with `by` dates); serialization, parsing, per-item caps, legacy migration. The old Self-model section is gone from the WRITER — patterns live in the direction Portrait now — but parseCard still reads it on legacy cards (the migration source) |
| `card-session.ts` | The mutation session behind the agent's write tools — in-memory CardDocument + per-entry validated mutations (`addNow` / `updatePastProfile` / `resolveHorizon` / …), loop brake (repeated identical rejections escalate → force-apply/skip), substance comparison. Pure, no I/O |
| `flash/backfill-marks.ts` | Opportunistic dry-slice remediation — on a close boundary, a sub-agent (main model via the shared runner) fills focus/summary for up to 3 `needs_marking` slices, inside the turn's batch |
| `timeline/` | Canonical catalog (`store.ts`: `timeline/index.json` + upsert), `weave.ts` projection reconcile ("slices are truth, timeline is a projection"), `render.ts` pointer lines (incl. `sliceLineWithTime`), `enumerate.ts` repo enumeration (default-branch aware) |
| `io-helpers.ts` | I/O wrappers delegating to demo-fs, GitHub API, or local FS. Batching is an EXPLICIT `WriteBatch` object (`createBatch()` → thread through I/O calls → `flushBatch(batch, msg)`) — never module-global, so concurrent turns in one process can't flush each other's writes. A failed flush keeps the queue for retry. Local-backend writes additionally record a best-effort git commit when the memory root is a git repo (see `local-git.ts`) |
| `local-git.ts` | Best-effort git ledger for the local backend (isomorphic-git, no git binary needed): bare `fsWriteFile` = one commit, `flushBatch` = one commit for the batch. The filesystem stays the source of truth — commit failures are warned and swallowed, and the layer is inert when the memory root has no `.git` |
| `slice-mutex.ts` | In-process per-sliceId async mutex (`withSliceLock`) serializing housekeeping/finalizeTurn on the same slice; acquired inside a single step only |
| `turn-merge.ts` | `mergeTurnsWithRemote` — pure append-only turn merge used by finalizeTurn's write-conflict self-heal (re-read remote core.md, append missing turns by turnId, retry commit ≤ 2×) |
| `rework-signal.ts` | Mechanical-signal instrumentation (v1.0 design §2.6) — module-level per-conversation record of recall outcomes; classifies each main-agent `readSlice` as `verify` / `rework`, plus the UI-driven interaction signals (`interaction_regenerate`, recorded by housekeeping from the regenerate body flag; `interaction_interrupt`, POSTed to `/api/episodic/signal` when the user stops a turn). Every signal lands in BOTH the machine-readable fitness store and an audit line in the slice's agent.md. Best-effort — never fails the caller |
| `strand-files.ts` | Strand entity layer — one `strands/<name>.md` per strand (frontmatter: `first_seen` / `last_active` / `aliases`; body: 1-2 paragraphs of natural-language description). Read by recall (listStrands carries truncated summaries, readStrand the full text) for SEMANTIC strand matching; written ONLY by the strand-consolidator, behind `gateStrandDescriptionRefresh`. Missing dir/file degrades to the bare index |
| `../evolution/` | Evolution data layer + loop (v1.0 design §2): `paths.ts` (file constants), `store.ts` (typed I/O over `memory/evolution/` + `memory/agent-playbooks/` — direction doc, per-sub-agent playbooks, generation-scoped fitness event/signal store with structural evidence-anchoring + the generation settle (`resetFitnessGeneration`), generation net scores), `triggers.ts` (deterministic trigger computation (v0.9.2): a bucket's current-generation net ≤ -5 fires it — purely quantitative, no semantic fast paths), `direction-agent.ts` (the direction contract — Portrait (six fixed dimensions) + hypothesis-pool skeleton, mode detection (bootstrap/migrate/steady), structural proposal validation, the L1b system-prompt layer builder; plus the legacy standalone evaluator) |

## Key Flows

### 1. Time slice lifecycle

1. **Create** — `createSlice()` in `manager.ts` is called when the chat route receives a message with no active slice (or after context loss/close). Derives `slice_id` from the UTC date+time of the first message (e.g. `2026-07-07-1558`), creates an in-memory `TimeSlice` with the first turn.
2. **Extend** — `appendTurn()` adds subsequent turns to the in-memory slice. `saveSliceSnapshot()` writes the slice to disk as a checkpoint every N turns and on `beforeunload`.
3. **Close** — Triggered by: slice age cap (30 min from slice start), context loss (page refresh / device switch), or turn count cap (safety net). `closeSlice()` sets `status: "closed"`, writes the MD file, updates `_index.json` and `strands.json`. The cycle repeats with a new slice.
4. **Recover** — `tryLoadTodaySlice()` scans today's directory (`slices/YYYY/MM/DD/`) and re-hydrates the most recent slice still marked `active` on page refresh.

### 2. Turn analyze (per turn, in housekeeping)

1. `housekeeping` first decides the slice lifecycle (pure — continue / close / create), then calls `analyzeTurn` (main model via the shared runner, thinking ON at low effort) ONCE with the user message + existing strand names + (when closing) the closing slice's turns.
2. The call returns: 0-5 message tags (reusing existing tags across languages), a semantic hint (which existing strands the message relates to), the user's intent, and — only when a slice is closing — its `focus` / `summary` / refined `tags` / `emotional_tone`.
3. The close marking is applied to the closing slice BEFORE `closeSlice` persists it, so the timeline and monthly index carry real descriptions.
4. Message tags are written to `slice.tags` and woven into `strands.json` via `updateStrands()` during the snapshot save.

### 3. Episodic state for the UI

1. `getEpisodicState()` (server action in `actions.ts`) scans monthly indices backward, returns the most recent slice as `active` plus up to 2 more as `recent`, plus a `hasMore` flag for pagination.
2. `getSlicePageWithContent(before, limit)` pages the full timeline catalog (`timeline/index.json`) backwards from the `before` cursor, filling each slice's turns in the same request — the scroll-back channel of the unified message flow (v0.10). `getArrivalState()` decides resume-vs-briefing on arrival using `slicing.idleGapMinutes`.
3. `getSliceContent(sliceId)` reads the full MD file, parses turns, and returns structured content for the detail view.

### 4. Card evolution (every boundary, two-phase + explicit trigger)

1. The evolution runs INLINE in the housekeeping step (v0.7b). Engineering owns the TRIGGER only: the trigger is the deterministic fitness scoring (`computeEvolutionTriggers` — GENERATION semantics (v0.9.2): a bucket fires when its CURRENT-GENERATION net reaches -5, purely quantitative, no semantic fast paths) combined with the card bucket's legacy gates — the analyzer's `evolve_card.worth` judgment (failure defaults to true) and a legacy (pre-v5) card forcing a run. A SUCCESSFUL fitness-triggered run settles the generation (`resetFitnessGeneration` clears all buckets' events + signals — a "checked, no change" verdict included; a failed run settles nothing; non-fitness-gated runs never settle). No trigger and no card gate → NO evolution sub-agent runs. Explicit user requests — including behavioral corrections, not just "记住…" phrasing — are detected via `memory_update` and trigger an immediate (card-only) run — the INSTRUCTION channel, not selection pressure. Progress streams via `data-evolution` chunks.
1b. When a boundary triggers, evolution is ONE MERGED RUN (v1.1 — the old two-phase split is gone): the Previously Agent first evaluates `memory/evolution/direction.md` — the loop's USER PORTRAIT + HYPOTHESIS POOL (fixed skeleton: `# Portrait` with six fixed `##` dimensions — Traits & cognitive style / Triggers & rhythms / Patterns & loops / Strengths & resilience / Communication preferences / Values & boundaries — entries portrait-grade: cross-context, outliving their evidence, predictive; slice pointers only in trailing `— refs:` tails / `# Hypotheses`: a bounded dynamic pool of ≤10 trait-level guesses, confirmed → promoted into the Portrait in the same run, refuted → removed, unverified 4 slices → retired — the TTL enforced in code) — and moves it through ATOMIC direction mutation ops (`applyDirectionOps`; the doc is never rewritten wholesale); `runCardEvolution` then runs the whole-doc gate mode-aware (steady: ≥2 distinct slice pointers across the doc; bootstrap/migrate: ≥1) plus the TTL pass and writes via `writeDirection`. The card + triggered buckets' playbooks are then evolved under the possibly-new direction in the same run. The direction gate: MIGRATE (an old skeleton: # Direction / # Anti-goals, or the first portrait skeleton's # Evidence / # Log) is always due; BOOTSTRAP (never written) is due when material exists (legacy Self-model lines on the card, or any fitness events).
1c. Fitness deltas (the analyzer's Task 7, or the bridge report's `fitness` array) are persisted right after the analysis via `appendFitnessEvents` — the store force-zeroes evidence-less deltas structurally. There is NO mutation archive (v0.9.2): accepted writes land in the live documents only; evolution has no direction, so a mutation is never judged against its predecessor and nothing rolls back.
2. There is NO mechanical card pass: expiry/overdue/caps are the agent's decisions, enforced inside its write tools. Housekeeping computes overdue Horizon items read-only for turn priming and injects the time context (user-local date, Now ages) into the prompt.
3. The Previously Agent (main model via the shared runner, thinking on at low effort) edits an in-memory copy of the card through per-entry mutation tools (`addNow`, `updatePastProfile`, `resolveHorizon`, …). Over-limit / malformed writes are REJECTED with compression instructions — the agent decides what survives a cap; a loop brake escalates repeated identical rejections (2nd: exact arithmetic; 3rd: force-apply truncated for length violations, skip + finish-now otherwise). A pass that hits the step cap without `finish` returns a PARTIAL card (mutations kept, note flagged) instead of failing. It normally ends with a `finish` call.
4. The serialized result is written back only when the card's substance changed (stamps ignored) — both the live card and the per-slice snapshot.

The v1.0 evolution data layer (design §2, `src/lib/evolution/`) adds two more
locations OUTSIDE `memory/episodic/`:

```
memory/evolution/
  direction.md                  -- cross-slice user portrait + hypothesis pool (design §2.2)
  fitness.json                  -- bounded fitness events + mechanical signals (§2.5/§2.6)
memory/agent-playbooks/
  recall.md / search.md / thinkdeep.md   -- per-sub-agent evolved playbooks (§2.4)
```

**Strands.** A slice carries `tags` (keywords). A **strand** is a keyword woven
through all the slices that carry it — one entry in `strands.json` maps a strand
to its slice paths, i.e. "the whole history of that thing" across time. It's the
thin, lossless semantic-memory layer over the episodic slices. Tags are extracted
by the turn analyzer in the housekeeping step and woven into strands at snapshot time.

On top of the index sits the **strand entity layer** (`strands/<name>.md`, see
`strand-files.ts`): one file per strand carrying a natural-language description
(1-2 paragraphs) plus `first_seen` / `last_active` / `aliases` frontmatter. The
recall sub-agent reads it for semantic strand matching — `listStrands` carries a
truncated one-line summary per described strand, `readStrand` the full text —
so a question phrased with synonyms or in another language can still find the
right thread. Old memory roots without a `strands/` directory degrade to the
bare keyword index. The **strand-consolidator is the ONLY writer** of entity
files, behind a mechanical gate: a refresh requires ≥5 new associated slices
since the entity's `last_active` AND a 7-day cooldown since then, and the update
call itself must carry the triggering slice ids as evidence (the LLM prompt is
required to ground the description in them). `first_seen` / `last_active` are
derived from the slice paths mechanically, never from the model.

## Design Decisions

- **Tag extraction in housekeeping**: A quick low-effort sub-agent call (main model via the shared runner) extracts tags from each user message. Existing tags are preferred to encourage cross-language semantic merging (e.g., "self-evolution" and "自我进化" reuse the same tag).
- **Client-history mismatch → window rebuild, not a close**: When the client-sent history no longer matches the active slice (page refresh, device switch, stale local writes — `checkClientHistoryMismatch` in `steps.ts` compares the slice-aligned user-turn tail), the slice STAYS OPEN: the model history window is rebuilt from the slice's own turns (`rebuiltHistory` in the HousekeepingResult, used verbatim by `buildHistoryWindow` in `turn-workflow.ts`) and a one-line warning is logged. The old `"context_lost"` CLOSE signal is legacy-only — kept in the `SlicingSignal` union so historical slices still parse and seam-classify as boundaries, but never emitted.
- **Main agent reads only**: The main agent never modifies previously.md. The Previously Agent (main model via the shared runner) edits the card through validated mutation tools; mechanical writes (slice tags, strands) happen in housekeeping and finalizeTurn. Card evolution runs INLINE in the housekeeping step, gated by the analyzer's `evolve_card.worth` judgment (a legacy-format card forces a run).
- **Pure time-based slicing with idle-gap close**: The primary slicing triggers are slice age (30 min from slice start, `"time_cap"`) and idle gap (30 min since the last turn, `"idle_gap"`). Turn count cap is a pure safety net (`"capacity"`). `time_cap`/`capacity` are autosave CHECKPOINTS of the same conversation — the new slice links back via `continuesFrom` and carries the closed slice's last 10 turns as a frozen history prefix; `idle_gap` is a genuine conversation boundary (no link, no carry-over). A client-history mismatch is NOT a slicing trigger — it rebuilds the window from the slice (see above). `"time_silence"` and `"context_lost"` are legacy `closed_by` values kept for historical slices.
- **In-memory active slice with periodic snapshots**: The slice is held in a module-level variable. It is snapshotted to disk periodically (every N turns, `beforeunload`) but not on every turn -- avoids excessive GitHub API writes. `tryLoadTodaySlice()` recovers state on refresh.
- **Gray-matter serialization**: Slices use `---` YAML frontmatter + markdown body, parsed via `gray-matter`. Turn headers follow the convention `## Turn {id} — ISO_TIMESTAMP (role)`.
- **Dual storage backend**: Local filesystem (dev) vs. GitHub API (production) selected at import time via a `USE_GITHUB` flag. The `fsReadFile`/`fsWriteFile`/`fsListFiles` wrappers in `io-helpers.ts` delegate transparently.
- **Demo mode extends scan range**: with the demo data source (`STORAGE=demo`), `actions.ts` scans up to 48 months back instead of 1-2, supporting pre-seeded demo personas.

## Known Limitations

- **Turn-header collision**: a message body containing a line shaped like `## Turn {id} — ISO (role)` splits slice parsing incorrectly (pinned by a guard test in `manager.test.ts`).
- **Strand descriptions are consolidation-pass-only**: entity files are refreshed at slice-close consolidation (capped at 10 LLM refreshes per pass), never per turn — a brand-new strand therefore carries no description until it has ≥5 slices and survives the cooldown.
