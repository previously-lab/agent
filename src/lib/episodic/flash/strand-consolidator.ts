/**
 * Strand Consolidator — the LLM merge pass for the strand index.
 *
 * The deterministic layer (normalization + normalized-match merge in
 * strands.ts) catches mechanical duplicates (`Apex`/`apex`). But the model
 * itself minted semantic duplicates — typos (`陈勇超`/`陈永超`), the
 * same concept under two names (`心态`/`心态调整`), and concept families
 * (`面试评估`/`面试复盘`/`面试问题`). Those need semantic judgment, which is
 * this module's job: an LLM pass proposes a from→to merge map; the
 * engineering layer applies it (path-union + key removal) and then prunes
 * single-use stale strands.
 *
 * Runs opportunistically at slice close (see housekeeping). Since v0.9 the
 * pass runs through the shared sub-agent runner
 * (src/lib/agents/sub-agent-runner.ts) on the turn's MAIN model — thinking on
 * at low effort, static system prompt (shared base + role), dynamic strand
 * index in the user prompt. Never throws — on any failure it returns the
 * input index unchanged so housekeeping degrades gracefully.
 *
 * v0.15: the strand DESCRIPTION layer graduated into the document system —
 * strand entity files became topic homes (`memory/docs/topic/`, design §3.2),
 * and their maintenance (along with the old ≥5-slices / 7-day-cooldown /
 * ≤10-per-pass semantic gates, all deleted per axiom D) moved to the
 * librarian (flash/librarian.ts). This module now owns ONLY the mechanical
 * merge machinery; when merges land, housekeeping asks the librarian to void
 * the merged-from homes.

A "strand" is a keyword threading through time slices (slices/YYYY/MM/DD/HHMM). The user message carries the current strand index, mapping each strand to how many slices carry it.

## Task

Find NEAR-DUPLICATE strands — the same durable concept, person, company, or topic recorded under two or more names — and propose merging them into ONE canonical key.

Merge when they clearly denote the same thing:
- Typos / alternate spellings (陈勇超 vs 陈永超)
- Same concept in two names (心态 vs 心态调整; 面试评估 vs 面试复盘)
- Same entity written differently (Apex vs apex — case variants)
- Concept + derived-subtopic that are really the same thread (plaud vs plaud策略)

DO NOT merge:
- Distinct concepts that merely share a word (公司注册 vs 公司评估)
- A broad topic with a genuinely separate subtopic you'd want to recall independently
- Keys with zero slices in common and no clear same-concept basis

## Rules

1. Every \`to\` key MUST already exist in the provided index.
2. Prefer keeping the more specific / more used / more canonical name as \`to\`.
3. Do not propose a chain (A→B and B→C in the same pass). Each merge is independent: from → to.
4. When in doubt, do NOT merge. Precision over recall — a wrong merge destroys thread history.
5. Empty merges is a valid answer when the index is already clean.

## Output

Call \`consolidateOutput\` with your merge map (or empty) + a short reasoning note.`);
