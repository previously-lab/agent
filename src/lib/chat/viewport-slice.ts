/**
 * The slice currently at the top of the chat stream's viewport — published by
 * ChatPage (the stream reports its top visible item), read by the header mode
 * switcher when it builds the `/?view=timeline&at=…` href so the 3D camera
 * docks at the slice the user was reading (v0.11 双向上下文携带). Same
 * module-level discipline as slice-jump.ts / turn-busy.ts: no provider, no
 * dependency.
 *
 * `null` = the viewer is at the live bottom ("now") or nothing is published —
 * the switcher then opens the timeline without an `at` anchor.
