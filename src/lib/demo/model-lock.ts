/**
 * Demo-mode model lock.
 *
 * PUBLIC demo deployments (the maintainer's, serving anonymous traffic on the
 * maintainer's API key) pin the model and thinking intensity server-side so
 * visitors can't switch to a pricier tier (V4 Pro) or crank reasoning effort.
 *
 * A self-hosted deployment can also land on the demo data source (prod with no
 * GITHUB_TOKEN auto-detects to demo) — indistinguishable from the public demo
 * in code, and there the key is the user's own. So the lock is OPT-IN: it only
 * activates when STORAGE resolves to "demo" AND DEMO_LOCK is truthy ("1",
 * "true", "yes"). Self-hosted deployments leave it unset and stay unlocked.
 *
 * The lock is applied in three places:
 *   - loadUserConfig (config/loader) — the client SEES the locked values
 *   - GET /api/models — the selector only lists the locked model (and hides)
 *   - startTurn (api/chat/start-turn) — the authoritative enforcement; the
 *     per-request client overrides are ignored while locked
 *
 * NOTE: because the project uses a Vercel ignore-command that skips builds when
 * only data files change, updating these environment variables may not trigger
 * an automatic redeploy. After changing DEMO_LOCK / DEMO_MODEL / DEMO_EFFORT,
 * push a code change or manually redeploy so the new values reach the runtime.
 *
 * The default targets the cheapest vision-capable DeepSeek tier so demo image
 * uploads work; override with DEMO_MODEL / DEMO_EFFORT when DeepSeek retires
 * the id — see DEMO_LOCK_DEFAULT_MODEL below for why a retired id breaks the
 * lock rather than merely failing to apply it.
 */

/**
 * Must stay a LIVE DeepSeek id. The catalog is live-driven — a curated-but-
 * retired id never reaches the selector, so the lock's `locked.length > 0`
 * check fails and `/api/models` falls back to the FULL list while `startTurn`
 * keeps enforcing the lock. The picker then offers models the server ignores.
 * That is what `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` did after DeepSeek retired it;
 * `deepseek-flash` (verified vision-capable, 2026-09) is the current id.
