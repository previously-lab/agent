/**
 * Web research — provider adapters behind a neutral contract.
 *
 * The webSearch tool's interface (query in → answer + sources + researcher's
 * confidence/controversies out) is OURS; nothing DeepSeek- or
 * Anthropic-shaped may leak out of this module. Today there is one adapter:
 * DeepSeek V4 Flash's native server-side search, reached through DeepSeek's
 * Anthropic-compatible endpoint (the OpenAI-compatible /v1 endpoint cannot
 * express provider-executed tools). Future adapters (Claude native webSearch,
 * Tavily for keyless demo) drop in behind the same contract and MUST also
 * produce the `recommendation` field.
 *
 * The search sub-agent is an independent RESEARCHER (v1.0): it searches
 * (web_search, provider-executed on DeepSeek's servers), then reads the most
 * promising pages ITSELF with its own quota-bounded `webFetch` tool
 * (implemented in-module via fetch-utils + the Document Segment Read
 * helpers), and synthesizes a real answer that combines the found material
 * with its own knowledge — web claims always carry a source mention.
 *
 * DeepSeek adapter specifics (not the contract — just this adapter):
 * - `web_search` is executed on DeepSeek's servers, which ingest the full
 *   page content during inference; the caller only ever sees the model's
 *   synthesized answer + citation URLs. The sub-agent's own `webFetch` closes
 *   the depth gap: pages that matter get read directly, on our side.
 * - `webSearch_20260209` is the @ai-sdk/anthropic SDK's method name for the
 *   provider-executed search tool, not our versioning — the SDK version is
 *   the authority for when to update it.
 *
 * @security — provider coupling. webSearch is currently a DEEPSEEK-ONLY
 * capability: this adapter always reaches `api.deepseek.com` and always needs
 * a `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, INDEPENDENT of the user's chosen chat model. If a
 * deployment's user selects Anthropic/OpenAI as the main model but omits
 * `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, webSearch will error rather than silently degrade.
 * A non-DeepSeek deployment must either (a) provide a `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` for
 * this infra call, or (b) add a new adapter behind the `WebSearchResult`
 * contract (e.g. Claude native webSearch, Tavily) and dispatch on it here.
 * Do NOT let a missing key crash the turn — `webSearchExecute` gates on it
 * and returns a user-facing error string before any model call runs.
 *
 * Model roles: this is an INFRASTRUCTURE model call (like recall in
 * lib/episodic/flash/recall.ts) — the user-facing Pro model choice is not
 * affected. The call itself runs on the unified sub-agent runner
 * (src/lib/agents/sub-agent-runner.ts): thinking ON at effort "low" (via the
 * Anthropic-shaped effort mapping — this adapter speaks the Anthropic
 * protocol), a 50-step cap, and a 240s wall-clock budget (sized for the 6-page
 * read quota). The provider path is unchanged: the runner receives a PRE-BUILT
 * model instance so the custom endpoint + normalizing fetch stay exactly as
 * they were.

Pages come back as Markdown (headings, lists, links and tables preserved). You may read at most ${maxPageReads} pages per run — spend them on the strongest sources. When a promising page's key content is an image, viewImage can look at it for you (up to ${MAX_IMAGE_READS} images per run).

Process:
1. Plan your search: you may use up to ${maxSearchRounds} search rounds. Round 1 may use the query as-is; every later round must either reformulate based on what you have learned or chase a new lead discovered in the material you have already read. Before issuing a new search round, state (in thinking) what is still missing.
2. Search, then read the most promising pages with webFetch between rounds when it sharpens your next query (use its range filters to keep reads focused).
3. When you have enough, call searchReport with:
   - answer: a real answer to the query (2-5 paragraphs), synthesizing what you found with your own knowledge. Every claim that comes from the web must mention its source. Answer in the query's language — it reaches the user, so it overrides the shared base's English default.
   - recommendation: your researcher's assessment — how confident you are, what is solid, what is uncertain or conflicting between sources.
   - suggested_reads: 0-3 pages worth a follow-up look (your colleague's own verification, or further reading for the user).

Distinguish what the sources SAY from what YOU know — never blend the two silently. If the search found nothing usable, say so plainly in the answer instead of papering over it.`;
