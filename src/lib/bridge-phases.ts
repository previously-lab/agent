/**
 * Phase-level bridge outsourcing (client mode + bridge brain).
 *
 * Instead of letting each housekeeping sub-agent (turn-analyzer, Previously
 * Agent, …) resolve to the bridge model and spawn its own CLI subprocess, the
 * WHOLE housekeeping phase is outsourced as ONE bridge call: the client agent
 * returns a single structured JSON report (turn analysis + closed-slice
 * marking + card-evolution decision with mutation proposals + fitness deltas
 * + the Phase-1 direction verdict, v1.0 §6); the kernel
 * validates it (zod + the existing card-session caps) and applies it through
 * the same downstream code paths as the sub-agent flow.
 *
 * Playbook evolution (v1.0 §2.4) rides the SAME report: the client proposes
 * playbook rewrites (report.playbooks) for triggered recall/search/thinkdeep
 * buckets and the kernel applies them through applyBridgePlaybookWrites —
 * the SAME bucket gate as the merged run's writePlaybook tool (a write for a
 * bucket that did not trigger is skipped, never written). Old clients that
 * omit the field keep the pre-playbook behavior (no playbook evolution).
 *
 * Wire contract (shared with the client repo — do not deviate):
 *   stdin : { task, context, phase: "housekeeping", protocol: 2 }
 *   stdout: the agent's final reply is EXACTLY one JSON object matching
 *           housekeepingPhaseReportSchema (stray prose around it is tolerated
 *           at extraction, never at validation).
 *
 * runHousekeepingBridge runs INSIDE the housekeeping step's invocation (same
 * as analyzeTurn / runCardEvolution, which also carry no "use step" of their
 * own) — the `"use step"` boundary stays on housekeeping() in
 * src/app/api/chat/steps.ts, because the withWorkflow loader only compiles
 * directives under src/app.
 *
 * Every failure (bridge error, malformed JSON, schema mismatch) comes back as
 * { ok: false, reason } — this module never throws (mirrors the analyzer's
 * never-throw degradation contract).

const HOUSEKEEPING_TASK = `You are running Previously's housekeeping phase — the per-turn memory bookkeeping of a personal agent. This task is the FULL contract — the judgment rules, input specifics, and output contract all live here; your workspace instruction file only lists the available commands and mechanics.

One pass, these jobs:
1. Turn analysis — merge-first tags (reuse existing strand names VERBATIM; create only genuinely durable topics), semantic_hint (existing strands this message is about), intent, memory_worthy (false for trivial turns: greetings / "继续" / thanks / small talk), memory_update (ONLY on an explicit record/evolve request or an explicit behavioral correction — the exact content, else null), emotional_signal.
2. Closed-slice marking — ONLY when the context says a slice is closing: focus (one sentence), summary (≤100 chars), 2-6 clean deduped tags, tone.
3. Card evolution — judge worth (when in doubt, worth: true — a wasted review is cheap, a missed evolution is permanent memory loss) and, when worth or memory_update is set, propose card mutations with the op vocabulary below. Never rewrite the whole card; entries you don't touch stay as they are.
4. Dry-slice backfill — ONLY when the context carries a "Dry slices needing marks" section: one backfill_marks entry per listed slice ({slice_id copied verbatim, focus one sentence, summary ≤100 chars}); [] when the section is absent.
5. Strand merge — ONLY when the context carries a "Strand merge candidates" section: propose from→to merges for NEAR-DUPLICATE strands (typos / same concept under two names / same entity written differently). Every "to" MUST be a name from the offered list; no chains (A→B and B→C in one pass); do NOT merge distinct concepts that merely share a word; when in doubt, do NOT merge — a wrong merge destroys thread history. [] when the section is absent or the index is already clean.
6. Fitness scoring — score ONLY what THIS slice's user messages explicitly signal: -2 explicit complaint/correction, -1 signs of dissatisfaction, +1 explicit approval, attributed to a bucket (card | recall | search | thinkdeep | interaction). Every non-zero delta MUST quote the user's exact words in evidence — no quote, NO entry. Nothing signaled → omit fitness entirely (an absent/empty array, never 0-delta filler). When the context lists a recall_rework / recall_repeat mechanical signal, treat it as a -1 CANDIDATE for the recall bucket, and an interaction_regenerate / interaction_interrupt signal as a -1 CANDIDATE for the interaction bucket (the signal's detail line may serve as the evidence); recall_verify is neutral — no entry.
7. Direction verdict — the context carries the current evolution direction (direction.md: the loop's USER PORTRAIT + HYPOTHESIS POOL — it describes WHO THE USER IS as a person and NEVER instructs the agent; it is NOT a log of what the user did; the card and playbooks are only its products) plus the card's legacy Self-model lines (rules to MIGRATE, see below). Judge whether the portrait itself should move. "no_change" is the common case — one slice's events are card/playbook material, never direction material by themselves; a single explicit durable user statement becomes a Portrait entry directly (descriptive: "用户明确不喜欢 X"), while suspected patterns enter the hypothesis pool first and promote only when confirmed across ≥2 distinct slices (or explicitly by the user). The new document has two fixed sections: "# Portrait" (CONFIRMED understanding, in six fixed "##" dimensions always all present: Traits & cognitive style / Triggers & rhythms / Patterns & loops / Strengths & resilience / Communication preferences / Values & boundaries; an entry is portrait-grade ONLY when it holds across contexts, outlives the event that evidenced it, and predicts — "用户面对不确定时先搭建结构再行动" qualifies, "用户周四聊了面试" is a case note and belongs nowhere here; NEVER imperative "you should/shouldn't" lines — if a line tells the agent what to do, phrase the USER PATTERN that motivates it instead; body text carries NO names/dates/events/slice ids — evidence rides ONLY as a trailing "— refs: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM, …" tail), "# Hypotheses" (a bounded DYNAMIC pool of GUESSES about the user's traits/patterns, ≤10, each line exactly "- [proposed YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM] <the guess> — falsify if: <condition>"; confirmed → PROMOTE into the matching Portrait dimension in the same run — a confirmed guess never lingers in the pool; refuted → remove; still unverified 4 slices after its proposed pointer → retire; refill the pool toward 10; guesses are about the PERSON, never predictions about events). Evidence bar: ≥2 DISTINCT slice pointers across the doc steady-state; ≥1 suffices when the mode says BOOTSTRAP or MIGRATE. LEGACY MIGRATION: when the mode says MIGRATE (the doc still uses an old skeleton: # Direction / # Anti-goals, or the first portrait skeleton's # Evidence / # Log) or the Self-model lines below are non-empty, fold every worth-keeping conclusion into the new skeleton wholesale — re-abstract event-shaped notes into portrait-grade lines (names/dates/events out, pointers into trailing refs), re-propose surviving guesses in the new format, drop the rest — and note the card no longer grows a Self-model section. A proposal violating this discipline is rejected by the kernel — and the direction moves ONLY through the direction ops vocabulary below (per-op structural validation; never a rewritten document).
8. Playbook evolution — ONLY when the context carries a "Colleague playbooks" section: for each colleague listed there (its fitness bucket TRIGGERED this run), judge whether its working notes need a rewrite from THIS slice's evidence — a trigger authorizes, never obliges; "no change" is the common and correct outcome for most triggers. Propose via playbooks: [{agent copied verbatim from the section, content (the FULL new playbook — short behavioral guidance, rewritten in place, not an archive), evidence (slice pointers / user quotes), expected_benefit (one line: what improves if this playbook holds)}]. The kernel re-checks the trigger and DISCARDS rewrites for buckets that did not trigger. [] (or omit) when the section is absent.

Mutation vocabulary (the evolution.mutations array):
- {"op":"setIdentity","content":"Name: Alan"} — one Identity head line (Name / Address them as / Pronouns / Alias).
- {"op":"updatePastProfile","content":"…"} — rewrite the rolling Past profile paragraph in place.
- {"op":"addPastAnchor","content":"…"} / {"op":"removePastAnchor","match":"…"} — durable fact / remove by substring.
- {"op":"addNow","content":"…"} / {"op":"removeNow","match":"…"} / {"op":"promoteNowToPast","match":"…"} — current-state hooks.
- {"op":"addHorizon","content":"…","by":"YYYY-MM-DD"|null,"refs":["<slice-id>",…]} / {"op":"resolveHorizon","match":"…","resolution":"…"} — open loops; resolve is the only way one leaves.

Direction mutation vocabulary (the direction.ops array — the ONLY way the direction moves; never a whole-document rewrite; entries you don't touch stay as they are; the kernel stamps every hypothesis's [proposed …] pointer itself and enforces the pool's expiry TTL):
- {"op":"add_portrait","dimension":"## …one of the six fixed dimensions…","text":"…","refs":["<slice-id>",…]} — a CONFIRMED portrait entry (descriptive, portrait-grade, no names/dates/events in text; ≥1 ref).
- {"op":"update_portrait","match":"…","text":"…","refs":[…]} / {"op":"remove_portrait","match":"…"} — replace / remove ONE existing Portrait line by substring.
- {"op":"add_hypothesis","text":"…","falsify":"…"} — a trait-level guess about the PERSON + its falsification condition.
- {"op":"promote_hypothesis","match":"…","dimension":"## …","text":"…","refs":[…]} — a CONFIRMED guess leaves the pool and enters the Portrait (portrait-grade re-phrasing) in the same report.
- {"op":"remove_hypothesis","match":"…"} — a refuted guess leaves the pool.

The card is a PURE semantic memory pool (Identity/Past/Now/Horizon — what the user did, is doing, will do): it NEVER carries rules, lessons, or analysis. Patterns/tendencies about the user belong to the direction Portrait (job 7), guesses to its hypothesis pool. One fact, one home.
