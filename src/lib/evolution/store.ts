 * direction-agent.ts); this module only guarantees the
 * data layer is safe to build on:
 *
 *   - All reads/writes route through io-helpers (fsReadFile / fsWriteFile), so
 *     demo / GitHub / local resolution — and explicit WriteBatch threading —
 *     behave exactly like the rest of the memory subsystem.
 *   - Missing files degrade to null / empty stores, never to errors: a fresh
 *     deployment has no evolution data yet, and that is a normal state.
 *   - Evidence-anchoring is STRUCTURAL, not prompt-level: a fitness event with
 *     blank evidence is force-stored with delta 0 (design §2.5 — "无证据强制归
 *     0"). No caller, however buggy or hallucinating, can score without evidence.
 *   - The stores are BOUNDED (newest ~200 events / ~200 signals): the files are
 *     read whole on every use, so unbounded growth would eventually flood every
 *     evolution prompt that quotes them.
