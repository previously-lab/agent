/**
 * Loop execution records — the "autonomous work" memory layer.
 *
 * A loop is a durable, multi-step task the agent runs on its own (backed by a
 * Vercel Workflow run). Its live execution record is written to
 * `memory/loops/YYYY/MM/DD/<loopId>.md` after every step, so the human — and
 * the agent's own future recall — can see what happened while they were away.
 *
 * Mirrors the shape of the (dead-code) file-driven loop engine in
 * `src/lib/loop/engine.ts`, but persistence and resumption are owned by the
 * Workflow runtime, not by re-reading a task file across HTTP requests.
