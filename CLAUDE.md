## About

A Next.js web application where a cloud LLM agent reads and writes repository state through a chat interface. The agent runs server-side and operates only on whitelisted data directories (`memory/`, `tasks/`, `sessions/`).

Every chat turn itself runs inside a durable Vercel Workflow run (`src/app/api/chat/turn-workflow.ts`), streamed back through `run.readable` and resumable after a dropped connection. The agent loop is AI SDK 7's `WorkflowAgent` (`@ai-sdk/workflow`): the chat turn's agent layer lives in `src/app/api/agent/` (factories, tool definitions, and standalone `"use step"` tool executors), so every LLM call and every tool call is an individually durable, auto-retried workflow step. GitHub files remain the single source of truth for memory — Workflow is only the execution container, never a store. There is intentionally no database/KV; cross-device reconnect is deliberately not implemented because it would require one.

## Project Architecture

**Three-layer separation**:
- **Browser/Phone** → user interaction surface
- **Vercel Pro (orchestration)** → receive triggers → read GitHub state → LLM decision → execute → write back
- **GitHub private repo (truth source)** → code (`src/`) + data (`memory/`, `tasks/`, `sessions/`)

**Key principles**:
- Code + data coexist in one repo. Code is agent-read-only, data directories are agent-read-write.
- Execution is stateless and event-driven. State lives entirely in GitHub files, not in a database.
- The agent's identity constitution (`identity/agent/CHARTER.md` — the single bedrock file: mission + the two documents' contract incl. the GROUNDING RULE + protocols + guardrails) is bundled at build time via `scripts/generate-identity.mjs`; all memory data (slices, timeline, strands, user card) is fetched at runtime from GitHub/local fs.

## Commands

- `pnpm build` — Production build with Turbopack
- `pnpm start` — Start production server
- `pnpm lint` — Run ESLint
- `pnpm test` — Run vitest (unit + integration)
- `npx playwright test` — Run Playwright E2E tests

## Architecture

### Layout Hierarchy

1. **Root Layout** (`src/app/layout.tsx`): Geist fonts + `ThemeProvider` + `<Toaster />`
2. **Locale Layout** (`src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`): `NextIntlClientProvider` + `<AppSidebar />` + main content
3. **Route-level**: Each route has `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` for full state coverage

### Internationalization (next-intl)

- **Routing config**: `src/i18n/routing.ts` — supported locales (`en`, `zh`) and default
- **Translations**: `messages/en.json`, `messages/zh.json`
- **Navigation**: Always use utilities from `@/i18n/navigation` instead of `next/navigation`.

### Theme System

- `next-themes` with `attribute="class"`, `defaultTheme="system"`
- `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>` tag
- Geist + Geist Mono fonts via `next/font/google`

### shadcn/ui

- Base UI primitives (shadcn's future direction)
- Components: `src/components/ui/` — 28 components (button, card, dialog, drawer, popover, select, tabs, tooltip, command, skeleton, avatar, separator, switch, label, input, textarea, scroll-area, dropdown-menu, sheet, alert, bubble, input-group, message, message-scroller, number-ticker, sonner, text-generate-effect, toggle)
- Utilities: `cn()` from `@/lib/utils`
- Toast notifications: `sonner` via `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx`

### Chat Component Architecture

Streamed message-part rendering. See `src/components/chat/CLAUDE.md` for full details.

1. **`ChatPage`** (`chat-page.tsx`) — Main container, useChat hook (WorkflowChatTransport), unified message stream
2. **`ChatMessage`** — Classifies `UIMessage` parts (text / reasoning / tool / data-phase / data-evolution) in a single pass, rendered in stream order
3. **`ThinkingSteps`** — Reasoning block (Brain icon, streaming subtitle)
4. **`PhaseIndicator`** — `data-phase` parts (slicing, housekeeping, etc.)
5. **`HousekeepingCard`** — Compact prep checklist (slice / analyze / tags / context / strands); the card-evolution run (`data-evolution` chunks) folds into it as the "evolution" row at its natural stream position, with an inline mutations diff
6. **`ToolRenderer`** — Dispatches to per-tool renderers (RecallToolRenderer, MemoryToolRenderer, ListFilesRenderer, CurrentTimeRenderer, WebSearchRenderer, DefaultRenderer)
7. **`ToolLayout`** — Shared expandable card with status icon/name/summary/expanded content
8. **`ChatInput`** — Text area + image attachments + submit/stop
9. **`MarkdownRenderer`** — `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` + `rehype-highlight`

### Skills System

- **File-driven**: Skills defined as `SKILL.md` in `.claude/skills/` directories
- **Discovery**: `src/lib/skills/discovery.ts` — scans directories, parses YAML frontmatter
- **Loading**: `src/lib/skills/loader.ts` — extracts body, substitutes `$ARGUMENTS`
- **Registry**: `src/lib/skills/registry.ts` — programmatic + discovered skills

### Providers

- **`ExpandedViewProvider`** — collapse/expand toggle context for tool views
- **`ReasoningProvider`** — thinking/reasoning duration tracking per message
- **`TodoViewProvider`** — todo panel visibility toggle

### Path Aliases

- `@/*` → `./src/*`

## Core Modules (Previously On unique designs — not from Open Agents)

| Module | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Capabilities | `src/lib/capabilities.ts` | Global app-mode checks: isAIConfigured, isDemo, canWrite, getRepoConfig (delegates data-source decisions to `src/lib/data-source/resolve.ts`) |
| GitHub Tools | `src/lib/tools/` | readFile/writeFile/listFiles via Octokit |
| Path Whitelist | `src/lib/whitelist/` | Security boundary: memory/tasks/sessions only |
| Origin Guard | `src/lib/security/origin-guard.ts` | Same-origin guard on POST mutation endpoints (`/api/chat`, `/api/episodic/flush`); optional `ACCESS_SECRET` key check for non-browser callers |
| Session Manager | `src/lib/session/` | In-memory session state with sliding window (legacy) |
| Model Registry | `src/lib/models/` | models.dev-driven catalog, provider dispatch, main-model resolution (`resolve.ts`) — single model: everything runs on the selected model |
| Time Rendering | `src/lib/time/relative.ts` + `src/lib/episodic/time-localize.ts` | Locale-aware relative-time annotations on slices/timeline/card reads, computed against the user's timezone |
| Turn Priming | `src/lib/turn-priming.ts` | v0.9: only the slice-stable pieces survive — the continuity line and the date-anchor table, frozen into the system prompt's L3 block at slice start. The per-turn `Sent:` timestamp / intent / emotional read were evicted from the system prompt (cache stability); the model reads precise time via the `currentTime` tool |
| Turn Analyzer | `src/lib/episodic/flash/turn-analyzer.ts` | The one housekeeping sub-agent call (main model via the unified runner, thinking ON at low effort): message tags + semantic hint + intent + `memory_worthy` / `memory_update` + (on close) slice marking and the `evolve_card.worth` gate |

### Episodic Memory (M8 — Time-Slice System)

The episodic memory subsystem (`src/lib/episodic/`, see `src/lib/episodic/CLAUDE.md`) is the memory layer:

- **Structure**: `memory/episodic/slices/YYYY/MM/DD/HHMM/timeline/core.md` — one directory per time slice (`timeline/core.md` + `agent.md` + a `previously.md` card snapshot), YAML frontmatter + conversation turns
- **Sub-agents on the main model** (v0.9): all internal calls (recall scanning, the unified turn analyze — message tags + semantic hint + intent + slice marking — card evolution, strand consolidation, mark backfill) run on the MAIN model through the unified sub-agent runner (`src/lib/agents/sub-agent-runner.ts`, thinking ON at low effort, shared `SHARED_SUBAGENT_BASE` prompt prefix). The old worker tier is gone entirely — single model: everything runs on the selected model. The main model handles the user-facing reply.
- **Close-time marking**: when a slice closes, the housekeeping analyze call produces its `focus` / `summary` / refined `tags` / `emotional_tone`, written into the frontmatter before the slice persists — so the global timeline and recall see real descriptions, not "(none)".
- **Slicing** (v0.9, pure time-driven + idle-gap): the slice age cap (`maxSliceMinutes`, default 30 min from slice START) is a periodic autosave CHECKPOINT — the follow-up slice links back via `continuesFrom` and carries the closed slice's last 10 turns as a frozen history prefix; the 50-turn capacity cap is a pure safety valve that checkpoints the same way. A silence of `idleGapMinutes` (default 30) since the last turn closes with `idle_gap` (genuine new conversation, no carry-over), as does context-loss detection (`context_lost`).
- **Slice-frozen system prompt** (v0.9): the system prompt is layered L0–L5 and anchored to the slice start, byte-stable within a slice to maximize provider prefix caching (DeepSeek automatic prefix cache; explicit ephemeral `cacheControl` breakpoints on the Anthropic path in `src/app/api/agent/agent.ts`). The history window is slice-aligned — the server trims client history to the current slice's turn count (mismatch → `context_lost` → new slice).
- **Write discipline**: batched writes go through an explicit `WriteBatch` (`createBatch()` → `flushBatch()`, `io-helpers.ts`); housekeeping/finalizeTurn on the same slice serialize through a per-sliceId mutex (`slice-mutex.ts`); write conflicts self-heal via append-only turn merge (`turn-merge.ts`).
- **Timeline**: per-slice `timeline/core.md` + `agent.md` are woven into the global timeline (`timeline/weave.ts`, `timeline/store.ts`, `timeline/render.ts`); `flash/global-timeline.ts` aggregates slice summaries and `flash/backfill-marks.ts` backfills close-time markings on historical slices.
- **Card evolution**: at a slice boundary the Previously Agent edits the card through validated mutation tools (`card-session.ts`); there is no mechanical card pass — expiry/caps/overdue handling are the agent's decisions, enforced inside the tools.
- **Strands** (semantic layer): a slice carries `tags` (keywords); a **strand** is a keyword woven through all the slices that carry it. `memory/episodic/strands.json` maps each strand → its slice paths ("the whole history of that thing" across time) — the thin, lossless semantic-memory index over the episodic slices. Built at slice-close via `updateStrands`; `flash/strand-consolidator.ts` merges near-duplicate strands; a richer first-class strand (rolling summary + recall integration) is a future milestone.
- **Demo data source**: `STORAGE=demo` (or auto-detected when no `GITHUB_TOKEN` and not dev) makes memory reads read-only against the `previously-lab/you` dataset repo (remote via `BENCHMARK_BASE_URL`, or a local sibling `../you` clone in dev). There is no `DEMO_MODE` env var — data-source resolution lives in `src/lib/data-source/resolve.ts`.

### Model Layer (multi-provider)

- **Catalog**: models.dev (`https://models.dev/api.json`) is the primary model catalog (`src/lib/models/catalog.ts`), gated by configured API-key env vars and reverse-filtered against each provider's live `/models` endpoint. Falls back to a curated list in `src/lib/models/registry.ts`.
- **Dispatch**: `src/lib/models/provider.ts` routes by SDK — dedicated `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, OpenAI-compatible for everything else: DeepSeek via `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` (the dedicated `@ai-sdk/deepseek` dropped image parts), `@ai-sdk/openai` catch-all for the rest (Kimi, Qwen, ...).
- **Main model** — user-selected in the chat toolbar; persists to `memory/user/config.json` (cross-device, no localStorage). v0.9: every sub-agent also runs on the main model (unified runner, thinking ON at low effort). Thinking is always ON at low effort for the chat main model (pinned server-side in `src/app/api/chat/start-turn.ts`); deep thinking is thinkDeep's job. Single model: everything runs on the selected model — the worker tier (`worker.ts`, manual pin) was removed.
- **Workflow model deserialization**: `register-model-classes.ts` registers anthropic, openai, and openai-compatible (DeepSeek) model hosts so models crossing the workflow→step boundary rebuild correctly.

### Chat Rendering

The chat component tree (`src/components/chat/`, see `src/components/chat/CLAUDE.md`) renders each assistant message as typed `UIMessage` parts in stream order:

1. **Reasoning** — `ThinkingSteps` (Brain icon), consecutive reasoning parts merged into one block.
2. **Phases** — `PhaseIndicator` for `data-phase` parts (slicing, housekeeping, etc.); compact phases merge into one `HousekeepingCard` checklist, and the card-evolution run (`data-evolution` chunks) folds into it as the "evolution" row at its natural stream position. (The old per-bubble `EvolutionIndicator` was retired in v0.9.)
3. **Tool calls** — `ToolRenderer` dispatches to per-tool renderers; recall renders as `RecallToolRenderer` with matched slices; `currentTime` renders as a single-line `CurrentTimeRenderer` card.
4. **Response text** — `MarkdownRenderer` blocks interleaved in natural stream order.

Tool calls use friendly outer labels with real tool names in expanded view.

### The rung ladder — one field, four zooms

The chat view and the timeline view are not two views. They are one field at
different zoom, and `src/lib/timeline3d/units.ts` is the vocabulary for saying
so:

| rung | one unit is | drawn as |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `conversation` | one slice | its TURNS (`SliceConversation`) |
| `slice` | one slice | a CARD (`RowGroup`) |
| `day` | a day's slices | a stack |
| `week` | a week's slices | a stack |

The two finest rungs share a GROUPING — both render one slice, so both are
`StackLevel` 0 — which is why stepping between them is the cheapest transition
in the ladder: nothing is regrouped, only re-rendered. `StackLevel` is
deliberately NOT renumbered to four values; `framePitchFor`, `groupForLevel`,
`rowKeyFor` and `backingSheets` all key off `0 | 1 | 2`, and the band's camera
multiplies it.

**One offset table.** `layoutFor` is the only place a unit's height is decided,
per rung: a card row states a formula, a conversation unit MEASURES its text and
reports upward. A unit that has not measured yet inherits the running height
rather than collapsing, so a freshly-paged window stays monotonic while it
settles. Everything positional — placement, rung transitions, the deep-link
landing, the fill pass — reads that one table.

**One feed, one publisher.** The left band reads the right pane through a single
mutable object (`src/lib/timeline3d/field-feed.ts`). Both fields are mounted
whenever the timeline is open (the chat one dimmed behind), so the shell hands
out a LEASE: the field that does not own the pane writes nothing at all. It used
to be four shared refs with four private ownership rules, and the band's
position came down to render order.

**Still to come** (see `doc/` plans): the two-view shell (`?view=`) cannot go
until the live streaming turn has a home at the conversation rung — the live
turn has no slice yet, so `SliceConversation` cannot render it — and the band is
still its own WebGL canvas, which is what the four-ref protocol existed to
bridge.

## Testing

### Three-layer testing strategy

| Layer | Tool | Target | Location |
|-------|------|--------|----------|
| **Unit + Integration** | Vitest (`node` env) | Pure functions, tool logic, serialization, guards | `tests/lib/` matching `src/lib/` structure, or co-located `__tests__/` |
| **Component E2E** | Playwright | Individual UI modules — render states, interactions | `tests/e2e/` |
| **Flow E2E** | Playwright | Connected user journeys across multiple modules | `tests/e2e/` |

### Test file conventions

- **Vitest**: `tests/<path>/<name>.test.ts` mirroring `src/<path>/<name>.ts`, or `src/<path>/__tests__/<name>.test.ts` for co-located tests. Both patterns exist; match the surrounding convention.
- **Playwright**: `tests/e2e/<name>.spec.ts`. Desktop (1280×720 Chrome) and mobile (iPhone 13) projects.
- Use `vi.mock()` with inline factories for module-level mocks. Use `vi.hoisted()` when mock values are referenced in both the factory and assertions.
- Use `vi.stubEnv()` or direct `process.env` manipulation for env-dependent modules (the project currently uses both; prefer `vi.stubEnv()` for new tests).
- Use `vi.useFakeTimers()` / `vi.setSystemTime()` for time-dependent tests.

### Testing requirements (mandatory)

1. **New features and modules must have accompanying tests.** Every new module, tool executor, guard, or pure function ships with a corresponding test file. The exit criteria is that `pnpm test` passes with zero failures.
2. **Changes to existing code must not break existing tests.** Unless the change is explicitly a functional or architectural pivot (which must be stated up front), the existing test suite must stay green. Run `pnpm test` before committing any change to existing code.
3. **If a change requires modifying existing tests to pass, explain why.** Modifying test assertions to match new behavior is sometimes correct — but it means the contract changed. Flag this to the user before doing it, with a clear rationale for why the old behavior is being dropped.

### What to test

- **New pure functions**: mandatory. If a function has no I/O and no side effects, it must have deterministic unit tests.
- **New tool executors / guards**: mandatory. Every rejection path and edge case must be covered.
- **Bug fixes**: must include a regression test.
- **UI components with conditional rendering** (loading/empty/error/success): should cover each state.
- **E2E**: at minimum, the core demo-user journey (open → chat → timeline → settings).

### Capabilities module

`src/lib/capabilities.ts` is the single source of truth for app-mode checks; data-source decisions delegate to `src/lib/data-source/resolve.ts` (`STORAGE=local|github|demo`, auto-detected when unset). All engineering-side code (tool executors, server components, API routes) should import from here instead of reading `process.env` directly. The AI model layer does NOT import capabilities — it learns about limitations through tool-executor rejections.

```
STORAGE set?                          (auto-detect when unset)
├─ local   → Local filesystem: full read/write (dev default)
├─ github  → GitHub API: full read/write (needs GITHUB_TOKEN)
└─ demo    → previously-lab/you dataset: read-only, CANNOT write
AI calls require at least one configured provider key (see getConfiguredProviders()).
```

## Current Phase (v0.9.1)

**Goal**: v0.8 shipped the timeline-centric memory — the per-slice `timeline/core.md` + `agent.md` files are woven into a navigable global timeline; the user card is **v5** (Identity head / Past: rolling profile paragraph + anchor facts / Now: agent-expired hooks / Horizon: future commitments with `by` dates — the Self-model section was retired in v0.9.1, its substance moved into the direction portrait) with hard caps enforced inside the agent's mutation tools (`card-session.ts`: Now ≤ 5, anchors ≤ 8, Horizon ≤ 5, profile ≤ 2400 chars); and every mutation endpoint sits behind the same-origin guard. v0.9 converged the execution design: pure time-based slicing, a slice-frozen layered system prompt, the `currentTime` tool, and a unified sub-agent runner (all sub-agents on the main model, thinking ON at low effort); background loops were removed entirely. v0.9.1 re-architected self-evolution around the user portrait + falsifiable hypothesis pool (see AGENTS.md "Darwinian self-evolution").

Branch: `feature/v0.9.1`

Key pieces:

- **Durable turn**: every chat turn runs in a Vercel Workflow run (`src/app/api/chat/turn-workflow.ts`) via AI SDK's `WorkflowAgent` with `stopWhen: isStepCount(20)`; timed-out steps are re-invoked with a continuation nudge under a hard cap (bounded continuations).
- **Evolution triggers**: at a slice boundary the turn analyzer's `evolve_card.worth` gate decides whether the Previously Agent (main model via the unified runner) runs; a legacy (pre-v5) card forces a run so format migration never waits. The agent edits the card through per-entry mutation tools (`card-session.ts`) — over-limit writes are rejected with compression instructions, never silently truncated; a loop brake force-lands repeated identical rejections, and a step-limit stop returns a partial card. An explicit user request or behavioral correction in the analyzer's `memory_update` field widens the fold-in beyond the boundary trigger.
- **Timeline subsystem**: `src/lib/episodic/timeline/` (weave / store / render / enumerate) plus `flash/global-timeline.ts` and `flash/backfill-marks.ts`.
- **Time rendering**: all read tools and the system prompt annotate ISO timestamps with the user's local/relative time (`src/lib/time/relative.ts`, `time-localize.ts`); a precomputed date-anchor table (frozen into the system prompt's L3 block at slice start) means the model never does date arithmetic, and the `currentTime` tool returns precise current time / slice elapsed time on demand.
- **Endpoint origin guard**: `src/lib/security/origin-guard.ts` blocks non-same-origin POSTs to `/api/chat`, `/api/episodic/flush`; when `ACCESS_SECRET` is set, non-browser callers must send `x-access-key`.

## Constraints

- Agent tools operate on whitelisted paths only: `memory/`, `tasks/`, `sessions/`
- The flush/episodic write path is further constrained to the active slice's timeline files (strict slice-id validation in `src/app/api/episodic/flush/route.ts`)
- API mutation endpoints (`POST /api/chat`, `/api/episodic/flush`) are same-origin guarded — see `src/lib/security/origin-guard.ts`; non-browser callers need `x-access-key` when `ACCESS_SECRET` is set
- `src/` directory is agent-read-only — no tool may modify it
- GitHub token is scoped to a single repository with contents read/write only
- All path validation is server-side; client is untrusted
- Base UI is the standard shadcn/ui primitive library (not Radix UI)
- **`maxOutputTokens` is NEVER set** on any model call (agent, thinkDeep, worker). It behaves inconsistently across providers — with DeepSeek thinking enabled the reasoning silently eats the shared cap and leaves empty/truncated output. Steps are bounded by the platform's 300s wall; on a kill the turn workflow continues the agent with a nudge (see `turn-workflow.ts`). Don't reintroduce it as a timeout or output guard.
