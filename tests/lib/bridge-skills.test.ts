/**
 * RECALL_SKILL_DOC — the recall sub-agent skill spec the kernel ships inside

 * skills/recall.md. These tests pin the doc's invariants so a careless edit
 * can't silently break the kernel↔client contract.
 *
 * v1.0 Phase A: the doc now mirrors the kernel recall COLLEAGUE contract
 * (src/lib/episodic/flash/recall.ts) — the sub-agent reads slices ITSELF with
 * the reader commands and answers with verbatim-quote references, instead of
 * the v0.9 pointer-only hits list.
